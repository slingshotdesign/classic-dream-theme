# classic-dream-theme
Brackets theme based on the Classic Dreamweaver Code Coloring.

The closest I could get to the Classic Dreamweaver theme with a libght background.

Can be used in Dreamweaver 2017 as follows:

* On Mac, right click on Adobe Dreamweaver CC 2017.app > Show Package Contents
* Go to: Contents > www > extensions > LightTheme
* Make a copy of the main.less and package.json files in case you don't like my theme and want to revert
* Put my main.less and package.json files in that folder instead.

If you want to edit the theme further, open up the main.less file and play.
